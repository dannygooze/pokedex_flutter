# pokedex_flutter

A project for fun used to learn Flutter, Google's UI toolkit using the Dart language.

## Getting Started

While there are a lot of things I can do to improve this app, I mainly was trying to see how quickly I could build a working prototype. The app lists pokemon regions, the pokemon in each region, then details for each pokemon.
